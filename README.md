# NYC Taxi Fare Estimation Project

New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles.
The agency has partnered with us to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior.
